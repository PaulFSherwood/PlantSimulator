Items to add

Components.hpp
    HumanFactors (shift_length_hours, training, fatigue, staff_on_shift)
    AlarmResponse (pending, ack_delay_s, repair_time_s)

Systems.cpp
    HumanFactorsSystem (compute fatigue from shift length/training; output reaction-time multiplier)
    ResponseSystem (if alarm active → start/advance ack + repair timers using multiplier; clear when done)
    (Minor) extend AlarmSystem to raise actionable alarms

SimCore
    Tick order: … → Hydraulics/Thermal → AlarmSystem → HumanFactorsSystem → ResponseSystem → Analytics

Scenario (loader/default)
    Seed site-level HumanFactors (12h vs 8h, training 0.6→0.8, staff count)

UI / KPIs
    Sliders: shift length, training, staff_on_shift
    KPIs: alarms/hour, median ack time, MTTR, downtime minutes, throughput delta

Analytics
    Optional Monte Carlo runner (vary fatigue/noise → confidence bands on KPIs)

  Fiber Seperation - screens, dewatering, dryers.
  Gluten Seperation - Centrifuges, dryers.
  Starch Slurry/Refining - filters, ion exchange, evaporators.
  Derivative Units (site dependent) - Dextrose, HFCS, Maltodextrin, Acids/Alcohols, Bioprocess/Fermentation, Ethanol Distillation, CO2 Recovery.
  Packaging & Loadout - baggin, bulk, tote, rail, truck

SITE UTILITIES (where many techs live)
