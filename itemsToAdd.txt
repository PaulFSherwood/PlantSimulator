    >HumanFactors (shift_length_hours, training, fatigue, staff_on_shift)
    >AlarmResponse (pending, ack_delay_s, repair_time_s)

Systems.cpp
    >HumanFactorsSystem (compute fatigue from shift length/training; output reaction-time multiplier)
    >ResponseSystem (if alarm active → start/advance ack + repair timers using multiplier; clear when done)
    (Minor) extend AlarmSystem to raise actionable alarms

SimCore
    Tick order: … → Hydraulics/Thermal → AlarmSystem → HumanFactorsSystem → ResponseSystem → Analytics

Scenario (loader/default)
    Seed site-level HumanFactors (12h vs 8h, training 0.6→0.8, staff count)

UI / KPIs
    Sliders: shift length, training, staff_on_shift
    KPIs: alarms/hour, median ack time, MTTR, downtime minutes, throughput delta

Analytics
    Optional Monte Carlo runner (vary fatigue/noise → confidence bands on KPIs)

Notes for Production and working areas.
CORE PRODUCTION:
  Grain Receiving & Storage - truck / rail pits, silos, dust collection, conveyors.
  Steeping - SO2/temperature control, tanks, heat exchangers, pH dosing.
  Milling/Grinding - wet mills, screen, pumps, classifiers.
  Germ Seperation & Oil - hydrocyclones, presses, hexane systems (if present).
  Fiber Seperation - screens, dewatering, dryers.
  Gluten Seperation - Centrifuges, dryers.
  Starch Slurry/Refining - filters, ion exchange, evaporators.
  Derivative Units (site dependent) - Dextrose, HFCS, Maltodextrin, Acids/Alcohols, Bioprocess/Fermentation, Ethanol Distillation, CO2 Recovery.
  Packaging & Loadout - baggin, bulk, tote, rail, truck

SITE UTILITIES (where many techs live)
  Boilers/Steam Plant - DA tank, feedwater, PRVs, condensate return.
  Ammonia Refrigeration (PSM) - compressors, condensers, vessels, purges.
  Cooling Towers/Chilled Water

There is a big problem that needs to be dealt with.  Most of the files were changed, or in some cases, not used.  I think I need to sit down and reorganize how this will be created and edited.
