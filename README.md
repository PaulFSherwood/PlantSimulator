# PlantSimulator
Provide an interactive, executive‑friendly simulator where leaders can preview proposed changes (process, staffing, safety, utilities) before touching a real plant. The app shows how changes affect throughput, energy, risk, alarms, downtime, and people. Think of it as a proposal flight‑sim for manufacturing.
